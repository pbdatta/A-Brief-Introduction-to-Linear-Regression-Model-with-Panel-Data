This presentation introduces the fundamentals of linear regression modeling with panel data, emphasizing its ability to capture both cross‑sectional and time‑series variation in a single framework. It begins by reviewing the core assumptions of the classical linear regression model—including linearity, homoscedasticity, no autocorrelation, normality, no multicollinearity, and exogeneity—and explains how violations bias coefficient estimates and standard errors. Panel data is defined (balanced versus unbalanced), and the presentation highlights its advantages for addressing unobserved heterogeneity and endogeneity compared to simple cross‑section analysis. Common issues in panel regression—such as misspecification, heteroscedasticity, autocorrelation, multicollinearity, and endogeneity—are described along with diagnostic tests (e.g., Breusch–Pagan, Durbin–Watson, VIF, specification tests) and corrective treatments. Multiple modeling approaches are overviewed, including between‑groups, between‑times, one‑way and two‑way fixed effects, and one‑way and two‑way random effects models. Estimation methods range from ordinary least squares and generalized least squares to more advanced techniques such as instrumental variables, Hausman–Taylor, Amemiya–McCurdy, and Parks estimators. The presentation details specification tests—F tests for fixed effects, Breusch–Pagan tests for random effects, poolability tests, and Hausman tests—to guide model selection and validation. It also covers panel‑specific diagnostics for cross‑sectional dependence (Baltagi–Li joint LM test, modified Rao’s score test) and serial correlation (Wooldridge test), as well as unit‑root tests for time‑series stability. The CRISP‑DM framework is introduced as a structured process for panel data analysis, stressing iterative model development, validation, and interpretation. Finally, the presentation acknowledges its own limitations—limited algorithmic detail, sparse visualizations, and minimal mathematical derivations—and provides a list of key academic references for further study.
